# Data Science Projects
This repository contains academic projects done be me.
Most of the projects are done in R studio using R Markdown and published in RPubs.

* **Data Mining / Machine Larning**
   * **Credit Card payment defaulter:** Given a dataset of credit card users, I am going to train different models to predict which users are likely to be payment defaulters. A payment defaulter is a user who fails to make a credit card payment for a specific pay period (usually one month). For this, I will employ different data mining techniques and compare the results each model yields to determine the best model for this scenario. The data mining techniques I use will aim to classify each user into one of two categories - not credible(will default next payment) and credible (will not default next payment).\
[The dataset I have chosen is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients#)\
Here are the models that I have built.

* **Some other work**
  * **D3JS**
    * [Board Game](https://csmodi20.github.io/D3JS-Node-Edge/) Click on any node to fix its postion and double click to release it.
    * [Interactive line chart](https://csmodi20.github.io/D3JS-Linechart_interactive/) Hoverover the points on the line and the barchart will pop up at bottom.
    * [Choropleth map](https://csmodi20.github.io/D3JS-choropleth/) Hover Over to any country to see deatil. Select any game from the dropdwon list to see its rating change.
